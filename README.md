Process Monitor Debug Logger
============================
This project implements support for Go programs to write debug messages
to Process Monitor's log when running on a Microsoft Windows computer or
virtual machine. Process Monitor is a helpful tool for monitoring
running programs and diagnosing problems with accessing resources at
runtime. This library makes Process Monitor logs more valuable by
outputting debug messages to Process Monitor providing context to the
operations that are captured and recorded in the log.
